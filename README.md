#### TODO
+ process update from local_planner in the decision node and send it to the translation/rotation node
+ understand structure of the grid map representation
+ assign a position (start, end, current) to a cell in the grid
+ plan a path from cell A to cell B in the grid
+ use robot's current and end position in planning
+ compare the robot's actual position with the desired one, if error > threshold, update planning
